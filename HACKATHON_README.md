## 🎮 User Journey Implementation

### Step 1: Reading & Selection ✅
- **Trigger**: User reads a document within the system
- **Action**: User selects text (e.g., "neural network training techniques")  
- **System Response**: Instantly surfaces relevant sections with semantic search
- **Performance**: Sub-second response with quality ranking

### Step 2: Insight Generation ✅
- **Beyond Simple Matching**: AI generates contextual insights
- **Cross-Document Analysis**: Finds overlapping, contradictory viewpoints
- **Practical Applications**: Suggests real-world uses
- **Grounded Results**: All insights based on user's uploaded documents

### Step 3: Rich Media Experience ✅
